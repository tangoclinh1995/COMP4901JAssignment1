Details about this assignment can be found [on the course webpage](http://cs231n.github.io/), under Assignment #1 of Spring 2017.

There are two files:

-   features-notTheBestDoNotGrade.ipynb
-   two_layer_net-notTheBestDoNotGrade.ipynb

These are the files I used to find the most optimized parameters. Please do not grade them. Thank you very much :D
